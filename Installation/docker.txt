Goal: Install Docker and run a test container.
macOS
    Install Docker Desktop
Open Docker Desktop and wait until it says it’s running
In Terminal:
docker version
    docker run hello-world

Windows
Install Docker Desktop
    Ensure WSL2 is enabled (Docker will guide you)

Test:

    docker version
    docker run hello-world

Quick checks when Docker acts up

    Docker Desktop running?
docker info works?

Any VPN/corporate proxy interfering?
