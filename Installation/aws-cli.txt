Goal: Install AWS CLI, configure profiles, and store access/secret keys safely.
Install AWS CLI

macOS

Install AWS CLI (official installer is preferred)

Confirm:
    aws --version

Windows
    Install AWS CLI MSI package

Confirm:
    aws --version

Configure credentials (recommended: profiles)
        Run:
    aws configure --profile dev
Enter:
    AWS Access Key ID (from AWS console / IAM)
    AWS Secret Access Key
    Default region (example: us-east-1)
    Output format (example: json)

This creates files:
    ~/.aws/credentials (keys)
    ~/.aws/config (region/output)

Verify the profile works
        Run:
            aws sts get-caller-identity --profile dev

You should see your AWS account/user/role identity.
Use the profile without typing it every time
    Option A (one command at a time):
        aws s3 ls --profile dev

    Option B (set environment variable for your terminal session):
        export AWS_PROFILE=dev

Then just run: aws s3 ls

Where to find keys in AWS Console (high level)

Go to IAM
    Select the user (or use role-based access if required)
    Create/rotate access keys (follow company policy)
    Copy keys once and store securely (password manager preferred)
Security note for your runbook:
    Never paste keys into code or commit to Git.
    Rotate keys regularly if your policy requires it.
